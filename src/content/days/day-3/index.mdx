# Day 3: Infinity War

In Infinity War, the heroes needed to gather the Infinity Stones - powerful artifacts that together grant ultimate capability. Today, we gather the capabilities that make your agent truly powerful: **Memory** and **Tools**.

Remember Day 1's disaster? Your agent forgot everything between requests. Today, we fix that - and add powerful new abilities.

## What You'll Build

Today your agent gains:

- **Persistent Memory**: Remember conversations and learn from interactions
- **Code Interpreter**: Execute Python code for analysis and computation
- **Browser Tool**: Navigate websites and automate web tasks

<Callout type="info" title="The Power Combination">
  Memory + Tools transforms your agent from a simple chatbot into a capable
  assistant that can remember context, execute code, browse the web, and
  accomplish complex multi-step tasks.
</Callout>

## Day 3 Architecture

![Memory Overview](/images/day-3/memory-overview.png)

Today we add Memory and Tools to give your agent persistence and real-world capabilities:

**AgentCore Memory** provides:
- **Short-term memory**: Recent conversation context within a session
- **Long-term memory**: Semantic extraction and retrieval across sessions
- **Memory branching**: Parallel conversation exploration for multi-agent systems

**AgentCore Tools** provide:
- **Code Interpreter**: Secure Python execution for data analysis
- **Browser Tool**: Web automation and research capabilities

## Learning Path

| Section | Topic | Time |
|---------|-------|------|
| 1 | [Memory Basics](/days/3/memory-basics) | 45 min |
| 2 | [Memory Strategies](/days/3/memory-strategies) | 45 min |
| 3 | [Code Interpreter & Browser](/days/3/tools) | 60 min |
| 4 | [Controlled Disasters](/days/3/controlled-disasters) | 30 min |

## Key Concepts

### AgentCore Memory

**Short-Term Memory**: Captures turn-by-turn interactions within a session
- Maintains immediate conversation context
- Users don't need to repeat information
- Integrated via Strands hooks (`HookProvider`)

**Long-Term Memory**: Extracts and stores insights across sessions
- User preferences and facts via extraction strategies
- Custom extraction with `StrategyType.CUSTOM`
- Semantic retrieval of relevant context

**Memory Branching**: Enables parallel conversation exploration
- Different agents explore specialized topics on separate branches
- Perfect for multi-agent systems
- Fork and merge conversations via `MemorySessionManager`

### Built-in Tools

**Code Interpreter**: Secure Python execution environment
- Data analysis and visualization
- Complex calculations
- File processing

**Browser Tool**: Web automation capabilities
- Navigate to URLs
- Interact with web elements
- Capture screenshots

## Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- [ ] Completed Day 2 (Identity + Gateway configured)
- [ ] Agent deployed to AgentCore Runtime
- [ ] Understanding of session management
- [ ] Sample data for testing (CSV, JSON files)

<Callout type="warning" title="Tool Safety">
  Code Interpreter and Browser are powerful tools. Today we'll use them freely
  to understand their capabilities. Day 4 adds the guardrails for safe production use.
</Callout>

## Today's Controlled Disaster

<DisasterScenario
  title="The Runaway Agent"
  symptom="Your agent executes rm -rf commands, infinite loops, or navigates to malicious websites without any restrictions."
  cause="Unrestricted tool access - the agent can execute any code or visit any site."
  solution="Day 4 introduces Guardrails to constrain agent behavior and prevent dangerous actions."
  dayReference={4}
/>

This disaster demonstrates why powerful tools require guardrails. By the end of Day 4, your agent will have both power AND safety.

## Ready?

Let's start by giving your agent memory.
