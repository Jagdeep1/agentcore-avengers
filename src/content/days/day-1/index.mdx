# Day 1: The First Avenger

Welcome to **The AgentCore Initiative**. Today marks the beginning of your journey from agent hobbyist to production engineer.

By the end of this day, you'll have a fully functional AI agent running in AWS AgentCore Runtime - and you'll understand exactly why that matters.

## What You'll Build

Today we're building **AgentOne** - a conversational assistant that can:

- Respond to natural language queries
- Use tools to perform actions
- Run in a production-ready AWS environment

<Callout type="info" title="Model-Driven Development">
  Strands Agents uses a **model-driven approach** where the LLM handles reasoning and planning.
  You define the tools and prompts; the model decides when and how to use them.
</Callout>

## Today's Architecture

### Local Development Phase

During development, your agent runs locally on your laptop:

![Local Development Architecture](/images/day-1/architecture_local.png)

You develop and test your Strands agent locally, with the agent invoking Amazon Bedrock LLMs in the AWS Cloud for reasoning. Tools execute in your local environment.

### Production Deployment Phase

After testing locally, you deploy to AgentCore Runtime:

![AgentCore Runtime Architecture](/images/day-1/architecture_runtime.png)

In production, everything runs in AWS:
- **AgentCore Runtime** hosts your agent in a secure container
- **Runtime Agent** executes your agent code
- **Runtime Endpoint** provides the invocation interface
- **Amazon Bedrock** provides the LLM capabilities
- Tools execute within the runtime container

This progression from local to production is the core of today's learning journey.

## Learning Path

| Section | Topic | Time |
|---------|-------|------|
| 1 | [Environment Setup](/days/1/setup) | 30 min |
| 2 | [Strands Basics](/days/1/strands-basics) | 60 min |
| 3 | [AgentCore Runtime](/days/1/agentcore-runtime) | 60 min |
| 4 | [Controlled Disasters](/days/1/controlled-disasters) | 30 min |

## Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- [ ] AWS account with admin access
- [ ] AWS CLI installed and configured
- [ ] Python 3.10+ installed
- [ ] Access to Claude Sonnet 4 in Amazon Bedrock
- [ ] Code editor ready (VS Code recommended)

<Callout type="warning" title="AWS Costs">
  This day will incur approximately **$1-5** in AWS costs, primarily from Bedrock model invocations.
  We'll cover cleanup procedures to minimize charges.
</Callout>

## Today's Controlled Disaster

At the end of this day, you'll experience your first controlled failure:

<DisasterScenario
  title="The Vanishing Context"
  symptom="Your agent forgets the entire conversation after each request. Ask it your name, tell it, then ask again - it won't remember."
  cause="AgentCore Runtime provides session isolation, but without the Memory component, there's no persistence between invocations."
  solution="Day 3 introduces AgentCore Memory for persistent conversation history and long-term knowledge."
  dayReference={3}
/>

This isn't a bug - it's a **learning moment**. Understanding *why* your agent forgets context reveals why enterprise features like Memory aren't optional luxuries.
