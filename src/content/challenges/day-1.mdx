# Day 1 Challenge: The First Agent

You've learned the fundamentals. Now it's time to build something of your own.

## Your Mission

Build and deploy a **custom Strands agent** that showcases your understanding of:

- Agent architecture
- Tool creation
- AgentCore Runtime deployment

## Requirements Breakdown

### Required (Must Complete)

These are the minimum requirements to pass Day 1:

1. **Custom System Prompt**: Your agent should have a unique personality and purpose
2. **Three Custom Tools**: Build tools that do something interesting and useful
3. **Local Testing**: Verify everything works with `agentcore dev`
4. **Deployment**: Get your agent running in AgentCore Runtime
5. **Invocation**: Successfully call your deployed agent

<Callout type="info" title="Ideas for Tools">
  - Weather lookup
  - Unit conversion
  - Random joke generator
  - Simple calculations
  - Date/time utilities
  - Text transformation (uppercase, reverse, etc.)
</Callout>

### Bronze Tier

Go beyond the basics with robust error handling:

- All tools should gracefully handle invalid inputs
- Error messages should be helpful and actionable
- No uncaught exceptions should crash the agent

### Silver Tier

Demonstrate professional-grade development:

- External API integration (weather, news, etc.)
- Comprehensive unit tests with pytest
- Test coverage for edge cases

### Gold Tier

Show mastery with advanced techniques:

- Multi-model architecture (use Claude Haiku for subtasks)
- Complete documentation of the vanishing context disaster

## Submission Checklist

Before marking Day 1 complete, verify:

- [ ] Agent responds correctly to test prompts
- [ ] All tools function as documented
- [ ] Agent is deployed and accessible
- [ ] You can demonstrate the vanishing context disaster
- [ ] Code is clean and well-commented

## Example Agent Ideas

Need inspiration? Here are some agent concepts:

### 1. Math Tutor Agent
Tools: calculate, explain_concept, generate_practice_problem

### 2. Travel Helper Agent
Tools: convert_currency, get_timezone, translate_phrase

### 3. Dev Productivity Agent
Tools: generate_uuid, base64_encode, format_json

### 4. Wellness Coach Agent
Tools: get_motivational_quote, calculate_bmi, suggest_exercise

## Getting Unstuck

If you're stuck:

1. **Review the sections** - Re-read Strands Basics and AgentCore Runtime
2. **Check the samples** - Look at [awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples)
3. **Simplify first** - Start with one tool and add more once it works
4. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until deployment to test

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">
  - Forgetting to activate the virtual environment
  - Missing type hints in tool parameters
  - Not cleaning up after testing (run `agentcore destroy`)
</Callout>

## Completing Day 1

Once you've completed the required items and any stretch goals you want to attempt:

1. Mark your completed items in the checklist below
2. The system will track your tier achievement
3. Day 2 will unlock when all required items are checked

**Remember**: The goal isn't just to check boxes - it's to deeply understand how agents work. Take your time, experiment, and learn from the disasters!
